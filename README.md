### Performance Overview

1. **Naive Search**: O(nÂ²) complexity, inefficient beyond ~10,000 boids.
2. **Uniform Grid (Scattered)**: O(n) complexity, ~17x faster than naive.
3. **Uniform Grid (Coherent)**: O(n) complexity, 30% faster than scattered.

### Key Results

- **Base Performance (23,333 boids)**:
  - Naive: 12.83 ms/frame
  - Scattered Grid: 0.73 ms/frame
  - Coherent Grid: 0.56 ms/frame
- **Optimization**:
  - Coherent grid improves performance by 30%.
  - Optimal block size: 256 threads.
